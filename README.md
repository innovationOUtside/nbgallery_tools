# nbgallery_tools
Tools and workflows associated with [`nbgallery`](https://nbgallery.github.io/).

`nbgallery` is *"an enterprise Jupyter Notebook sharing and collaboration platform"*, written in Ruby.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have an nice API or Python API/wrapper...

Nor does it (currently) have certain useful tools, such as a bulk uploader...

This repo provides a collection of hacks and utilities for working with `nbgallery` and maybe eve some workflow ideas too...


## Bulk Uploader

Use [`Selenium with Python`](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) to automate the browser mediated "manual" upload one or more files.
